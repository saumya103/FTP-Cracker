# FTP-Cracker
The objective of this project is to develop an FTP brute-force tool that tests username-password combinations to gain unauthorized access to an FTP server.
This project consists of two Python scripts:
1. advanced_brute.py – An advanced FTP brute-forcing script that supports
username lists, password lists, password generation, multi-threading, and retry
mechanisms.
2. brute.py – A basic FTP brute-force script that accepts a single username and a
password list.
The tool attempts to connect to an FTP server by iterating through different username-password
pairs. If successful, it saves the credentials to a file.
